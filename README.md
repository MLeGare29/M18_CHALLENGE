# BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER SYSTEM


## OVERVIEW

The landscape of the banking and financial sector changes over time. With that shift in the landscape, comes the evolution of the systems we use. On the horizon is the advent of Blockchain technology, which has a chance to disrupt the entire banking system, not just on a national level, but a global one. Spawned from a discontent in the current finance and banking system, retail banking customers turned to the use of decentralized platforms to store and move their money. Trust is a major element of the banking sector: If our clients don't feel they can trust us, they will not allow our institution to help them manage their finances. A major part of that trust is being able to account not just for the storage, but the movement of funds. With this project, we will demonstrate the beginning phase of a much larger infrastructure by creating a Blockchain Ledger System. Using the Python programming language to power the Streamlit web application that will be implemented, this interactive ledger will demonstrate transfering funds from a sender to a receiver using a Blockchain mainframe, which has a chance to be the future of banking, one we would be remiss not to explore in the nascensy of this financial revolution. With that said, this project will complete the following objectives:

1. Create a Record Data Class.

2. Modify the existing Block Data Class to store Record Data.

3. Add relevant user inputs to the Streamlit Interface.

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by storing records.


## TECHNOLOGIES

The installation requirements for this code are as follows:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) OR [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the VSCode IDE or the web-based IDE, JupyterLab, to run create and run this Python-based code and document. 

[Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) - An open-source app framework for machine learning and data science that enables users to create web apps using the Python programming language.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.


## USAGE

For the functionality of this PyChain Ledger, you must call the following imports from the Pandas Library:

```python
import streamlit as st
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, List
import datetime as datetime
import pandas as pd
import hashlib
```

Accessing JupyterLab in Bash: `Jupyter Lab`

Running the PyChain Ledger on the Streamlit web app in the IDE Command Line: `streamlit run pychain.py`
